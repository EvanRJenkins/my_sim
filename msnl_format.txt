MSNL is an acronym that stands for my_sim netlist


The currently supported component types are:
    ACTIVE,
    RESISTOR, 
    CAPACITOR, 
    INDUCTOR

All nominal values must be specified in floating point format.
Examples:
	10Ohm  ->  100.0f
	47uF   ->  47.0e-6f
	100mH  ->  100.0e-3f
Units are determined automatically by the specified component type.
Any units given in a .msnl file will result in an error.

Each line of a .msnl file describes an individual component.
The proper way to describe an active component is, for example:
	V1 ACTIVE SIN(5,100) A GROUND
Below is a syntactically INCORRECT but more clear description:
	Label: V1 Type: ACTIVE Value: SIN(Amplitude: 5,AngularFrequency: 100) Positive Node: A Negative Node: GROUND
Here is an equivalent example for a passive component:
	R1 PASSIVE 100.0f A GROUND
	Label: R1 Type: PASSIVE Value: 100.0f PositiveNode: A NegativeNodeL GROUND
